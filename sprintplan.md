# Sprint Plan: Self-Publishing Book Platform (Pay-Per-Chapter Model)  
**Implementation Environment:** Windsurf (Agent-based IDE)  
**Cadence:** 2-week sprints  

---

## Sprint 1: Core Author & Book Setup (Weeks 1–2)  
**Goal:** Enable authors to create and manage books/chapters.  

### Deliverables  
- Authentication system with roles (`author`, `reader`, `admin`).  
- Book model + schema (title, genre, description, created_at).  
- Chapter model + schema (title, number, price, draft/published).  
- Author dashboard (basic CRUD for books/chapters).  

### Acceptance Criteria  
- Authors can register, log in, and access author dashboard.  
- Authors can create/edit/delete books.  
- Authors can upload chapters and mark them draft/published.  

### Windsurf Agent Tasks  
- `backend-agent`: Implement auth service (JWT, roles).  
- `backend-agent`: Define DB schema for `Book`, `Chapter`.  
- `frontend-agent`: Build author dashboard UI (React/Tailwind).  
- `integration-agent`: Connect frontend CRUD with backend APIs.  
- `qa-agent`: Write integration tests for book/chapter creation.

## Sprint 2: Reader Experience (Weeks 3–4)  
**Goal:** Allow readers to discover, unlock, and read chapters.  

### Deliverables  
- Book discovery (by genre, trending, new).  
- Search (title, author, genre).  
- Chapter unlock logic with **mock credits**.  
- Reader UI (reading interface with dark/light mode + progress).  

### Acceptance Criteria  
- Readers can browse/search and see book details.  
- Free chapters open immediately; paid chapters require unlock.  
- Reading interface persists last read position.  

### Windsurf Agent Tasks  
- `backend-agent`: Implement search & browse APIs.  
- `backend-agent`: Add unlock validation logic.  
- `frontend-agent`: Build discovery pages + search UI.  
- `frontend-agent`: Build reading interface (progress save).  
- `qa-agent`: Write tests for unlock logic + browsing.

## Sprint 3: Payments & Payouts (Weeks 5–6)  
**Goal:** Implement credits, transactions, and author payouts.  

### Deliverables  
- Stripe/PayPal integration for reader credit purchase.  
- Wallet system (credit balance + transaction history).  
- Author earnings dashboard (per book/chapter).  
- Admin payout dashboard (approve/reject payouts).  

### Acceptance Criteria  
- Readers can buy credits; wallet updates in real time.  
- Readers can view past transactions.  
- Authors see total and per-chapter revenue.  
- Admin can approve payouts with status updates.  

### Windsurf Agent Tasks  
- `backend-agent`: Integrate Stripe/PayPal webhooks.  
- `backend-agent`: Implement wallet + payout models.  
- `frontend-agent`: Build reader wallet UI.  
- `frontend-agent`: Build author revenue dashboard.  
- `integration-agent`: Connect payments to unlock flow.  
- `qa-agent`: Write end-to-end test for purchase → unlock → payout.

## Sprint 4: Admin & Moderation (Weeks 7–8)  
**Goal:** Provide tools for moderation and fraud prevention.  

### Deliverables  
- Admin dashboard for flagged content.  
- Fraud detection alerts (abnormal reads/unlocks).  
- User suspension/ban flow.  
- Payout oversight audit trail.  

### Acceptance Criteria  
- Admin can view flagged books/chapters and act on them.  
- Fraudulent activity triggers alerts.  
- Suspended/blocked accounts lose access immediately.  
- Admin sees payout history with approval logs.  

### Windsurf Agent Tasks  
- `backend-agent`: Implement fraud detection service.  
- `backend-agent`: Add admin role actions (suspend, ban, approve payouts).  
- `frontend-agent`: Build admin dashboard UI.  
- `integration-agent`: Connect fraud detection alerts to dashboard.  
- `qa-agent`: Test flagged content + fraud alerts flow.  

---

## Sprint 5: Infrastructure & Analytics (Weeks 9–10)  
**Goal:** Deploy secure infrastructure and system monitoring.  

### Deliverables  
- Cloud storage (AWS S3/Blob + CDN) for chapters.  
- Encryption for content (at rest + in transit).  
- Centralized logging/monitoring (CloudWatch/ELK).  
- Analytics dashboard for admins (top books, chapters, revenue).  

### Acceptance Criteria  
- All chapters securely stored + accessible via CDN.  
- Logs capture errors, requests, and fraud events.  
- Admin analytics dashboard shows top-performing books.  

### Windsurf Agent Tasks  
- `devops-agent`: Provision AWS infra (S3, CloudFront, RDS).  
- `backend-agent`: Add logging & monitoring hooks.  
- `frontend-agent`: Build admin analytics UI.  
- `integration-agent`: Connect analytics API to UI.  
- `qa-agent`: Test system load and performance.

# Execution Notes for Windsurf  
- Each `agent` owns a slice of the backlog (backend, frontend, devops, integration, qa).  
- Agents coordinate via task dependencies (e.g., backend APIs before frontend UI).  
- All stories should map directly into Windsurf’s **task graph** for autonomous planning.  
- Sprint review at end of each cycle to promote stories from “done” → “production”.
