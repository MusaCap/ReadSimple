# Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
## Project: Self-Publishing Book Platform with Pay-Per-Chapter Model  
**Author:** Musa Capital CTO Office  
**Date:** 2025-08-22  
**Status:** Draft  

---

## 1. Overview  
We are building a **self-publishing platform** where authors can upload, publish, and monetize books in a **serialized, chapter-based format**. Instead of traditional royalties, authors are compensated based on **reader engagement per chapter**, enabling micro-monetization and incentivizing authors to create engaging content. Readers gain access to diverse stories with the flexibility to pay or unlock chapters incrementally.  

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives  
- **For Authors**  
  - Easy onboarding to self-publish books.  
  - Ability to publish by chapter (serialized publishing).  
  - Transparent payout model tied to **chapter views/reads**.  
  - Access to analytics (chapter performance, revenue earned).  

- **For Readers**  
  - Discover and read diverse stories.  
  - Unlock books **chapter-by-chapter** (subscription, micropayments, or credits).  
  - Personalized recommendations.  
  - Social features (comments, reviews, ratings).  

- **For Platform**  
  - Scalable content ingestion (support for text, images, metadata).  
  - Robust payout system tied to engagement metrics.  
  - Fraud prevention (fake reads, bot detection).  
  - Long-term scalability to multiple monetization models (ads, premium subs).  

---

## 3. Non-Goals  
- Full print-on-demand book publishing (out of scope for MVP).  
- Audio or video storytelling at MVP stage (possible later).  
- Enterprise-level publisher tooling (initially author-focused, indie-first).  

---

## 4. Target Users  
- **Independent Authors:** Writers seeking alternative publishing and income streams.  
- **Readers:** Young adults, fiction enthusiasts, and serial readers.  
- **Platform Admins:** Moderators, payout managers, content curators.

## 5. Core Features  

### 5.1 Author Features  
- Author dashboard (upload chapters, set price/free).  
- Real-time analytics (reads, earnings, ratings).  
- Payout account setup & withdrawal (via Stripe/PayPal).  
- Drafting vs. publishing states for chapters.  

### 5.2 Reader Features  
- Browse & discover books (by genre, trending, new).  
- Unlock chapters via credits, micropayments, or subscription.  
- Reading experience (mobile-friendly, dark/light mode).  
- Reviews, ratings, and comments per chapter/book.  

### 5.3 Monetization Model  
- **Per Chapter Payout:**  
  - Authors earn based on chapter unlocks/reads.  
  - Platform takes a % commission (e.g., 20%).  
- **Payment Modes (MVP):**  
  - Prepaid credit packs.  
  - Subscription (monthly credits).  

### 5.4 Admin Features  
- Content moderation (flagged books, reviews).  
- Fraud detection (suspicious spikes in reads).  
- Author payout management & reporting.

## 6. Success Metrics

  - Monthly active readers (MAR).  
  - Avg. chapters read per user per month.

## 7. Assumptions & Dependencies

- Cloud hosting (AWS/Azure/GCP) for scale.  
- Content storage in **S3/Blob** with CDN.  
- Legal/compliance review for payouts & content guidelines.
